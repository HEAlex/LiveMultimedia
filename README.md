How to use the low level Android media APIs to decode video live from the camera into a stream ready format!
This sample app works on Android L Reelease and a Nexus 5
I will use the new low level Media API to captue video and encode it into a H264/AAC format ready for a streaming server.
I will then create the server locally on the device and send the decoded output to it.
Full use of the hardware decoder is made, making encoding possible on teh fly at high resolutions.
User can extand this sample to add special effects to the video frames as they are decoded and streamed.
The possibilities are endless with this technology, basically anything you can dream up with Video and Audio
on Android can be done by enhancing this app.
